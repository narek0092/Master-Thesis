# Master-Thesis
Here you can find my Master Thesis on the effects on polarization due to the use of stabilizing or beam-steering mirrors in systems for quantum
communications and image polarimeters. The developed and used code to compute the variation in the polarization is annexed in the pdf document named TFM_NS.
